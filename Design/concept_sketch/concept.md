# Concept Sketches — The Shape of Climate Change

This document captures the early thinking and rough sketches that shaped the final visualization.  
These sketches do not need to be perfect — they show the *process* behind the design.

## 1. Initial Idea Exploration

### Concept A — “Growing Planet”
A single circle placed in the center grows larger as CO₂ increases.

**Reasoning:**
- Simplest metaphor
- Universal shape of Earth
- Easy for audiences to understand
- Works across screen, poster, and animation formats

**Sketch notes:**
- Light blue small circle → early years (safe)
- Medium orange circle → warming
- Large red circle → climate emergency

## 2. Visual Metaphor Sketch
Small → Medium → Large
Blue Yellow Red


A smooth gradient-style growth, with color blending across transitions.

## 3. Timeline Interaction Sketch
Rough layout of user controls:

[ Year label ]
|
[ CO2 circle ]
|
[ Play ] [ Pause ]
[ Speed Slider ]
[ Year Scrubber ]
[ Jump to Year ]


**Goal:**  
Keep all controls aligned vertically to avoid visual noise around the main circle.

## 4. Overlay Sketch (Top & Bottom)

### Top (Data Label)
Year: 1980 CO₂: 339 ppm

### Bottom (Meaning Label)
(Blue → Red legend)
“Rising concern” / “High risk”


These overlays make the visualization **self-explanatory**.

## 5. Alternative Concepts (Not Chosen)

### A) Spiral CO₂ timeline  
Circle expands outward like a spiral over time.  
Rejected because:
- too complex,
- loses clarity,
- less emotionally direct.

### B) CO₂ bars around the circle  
Bar chart arranged radially.  
Rejected because:
- too “data-heavy,”
- less metaphorical.

### C) Two circles (CO₂ vs Temperature)  
Rejected because:
- project scope expected **one strong visualization**,
- multi-variable visual reduces clarity.

---

## 6. Final Selected Concept
**“One circle, one story.”**  
The simplest metaphor became the strongest.

The final visualization is:
- centered,
- animated smoothly,
- color-coded meaningfully,
- emotional but scientifically grounded.
