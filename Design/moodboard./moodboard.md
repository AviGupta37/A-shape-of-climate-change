# Moodboard — The Shape of Climate Change  
This moodboard defines the visual direction, tone, colors, and inspiration for the CO₂ visualization project.  
It guides the aesthetic choices in the p5.js sketch and all supporting visuals.

---

## 1. Core Visual Theme  
**Concept:**  
“Climate data as a living form” — the CO₂ circle grows like a breathing organism, symbolizing Earth’s changing atmosphere.

**Keywords:**  
• Atmospheric • Scientific • Minimal • Futuristic • Clean contrast  
• Dark mode for data focus • Gradients representing intensity

## 2. Color Palette  
### Base colors  
- **Deep navy / space blue (#05060A)** — background  
- **Midnight teal (#1A2A3A)** — ambient gradients  
- **Soft white (#F5F8FF)** — text  
- **Muted cyan (#4FD1C5)** — UI accents  
- **Warm yellow (#F6E05E)** — mid CO₂ levels  
- **Warning red (#F56565)** — high CO₂ levels  

### CO₂ visualization mapping  
| CO₂ Level | Color (HSB mapped) | Meaning |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| Low      | Blue → Cyan        | Stable / safe |
| Mid      | Yellow / Amber     | Increasing concern |
| High     | Orange → Red       | Severe risk |
| Extreme  | Deep red           | Climate emergency |

## 3. Shape Language  
Shapes used in the sketch and UI:  
- **Circle / expanding rings** → growth of CO₂ levels  
- **Soft gradients** → atmospheric diffusion  
- **Smooth animations** → natural, living-system metaphor  
- **Rounded UI elements** → friendly science communication  

---

## 4. Typography  
Using **Space Grotesk** (Google Fonts)  
- Rounded geometric appearance  
- Modern scientific feel  
- Clean readability against dark backgrounds  

---

## 5. Texture & Background Inspiration  
- Space-like gradients (blues → black)  
- Atmospheric haze  
- Subtle glow around circles  
- Shadows to create depth without clutter  

---

## 6. UI Inspiration  
Elements based on futuristic data dashboards:  
- Glass-like panels  
- Gradient sliders  
- Floating rounded buttons  
- Minimal white text + accent colors  
- Focus on **interaction clarity** over decoration  

---

## 7. Narrative Mood  
The visualization aims to feel:  
- Scientific yet emotional  
- Calm but gradually alarming  
- Minimal but meaningful  

It should pull the audience into thinking:  
> “Why is the circle growing so fast? What does this shape mean for our planet?”

This is core to **science communication** — turning abstract numbers into intuitive visual meaning.
